# Bizent
An app to curate profiles of others 
Place people into different categories (friends, Camp 2015, recruiters, employers, etc.) with pre-determined and customizable form fields
Intended to create profiles of people that will help you remember them and specific things about them that they do not include in their public profiles on other social media sites 

Have working connection to MongoDB database and backend design, but looking to expand in terms of front-end (React or Angular) and some more dynamic features. 

To run on your local machine, use "npm init" to create package.json file and then "npm install" to install all of the node modules.
